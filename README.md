## ðŸ“Œ About the Project

Hello! This is my **first full-stack project**. While I'm aware of some critical mistakes (like exposing `.env` files), this project serves as:
- A learning experience
- A demonstration of my current skills
- A foundation for improvement

> **Note**: This is a demo project. In production environments, sensitive files should never be exposed.
